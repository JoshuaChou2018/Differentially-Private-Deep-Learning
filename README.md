# Update

This repo in migrated to https://github.com/MSRA-COLT-Group/Differentially-Private-Deep-Learning. All updates will only be pushed to the new repo.

# Differentially-Private-Deep-Learning

This repo will use Pytorch to implement several algorithms for learning with differential privacy including DP-SGD \[1\], GEP \[2\], and RGP \[3\].

\[1\]: https://github.com/tensorflow/privacy

\[2\]: https://github.com/dayu11/Gradient-Embedding-Perturbation

\[3\]: https://github.com/dayu11/Reparametrized-Gradient-Perturbation/tree/master/rgp_cifar


The above algorithms will be integrated into this repo in the near future.
